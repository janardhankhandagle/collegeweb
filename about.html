                    Dear Students,
                    
                    B.G.P.S. has played a pioneering role in profession and technical education in Marathwada region .The campus comprises of engineering, pharmacy and management college.
                    
                    The mission of Bhartiya Gramin Punarracha Sanstha (BGPS) is to help region and other developing state to improve their engineering practices both in the private and in the public sectors, and superior public policies. It seeks to do this through producing effective engineers who will pioneer new engineering practices and set new standards; through producing teachers and researchers who will generate new ideas of International significance
                    
                    That is, we have to produce engineers who can worl efficiently across the globe, who can excel in a multi culture environment, and who can negotiate confidently across culture. Further, we have to benchmark ourselves on a global scale with the best engineering education institutions and become the institution –of-choice for the best students residing all over country. This is a big challenge indeed, knowing the potential of faculty we have no doubt that this objective will be achieved and exceeded. </div>

                <p class="lead">Dear Student,
                    It gives me great pleasure in welcoming you to Hi-Tech Institute of Technology (HIT), Aurangabad—an established and leading engineering institute from the Marathwada region of Maharashtra State, India. Currently, the institute offers B.E. degree programs of the Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University, Aurangabad, in four disciplines: Civil, Computer Science & Engineering, Mechanical.
                    
                    HIT has a large and quiet campus with a well-maintained infrastructure, including laboratory equipment that is one of the best among the private engineering colleges in this region.
                    Our institute has had a glorious past record of academic achievements. Our students have regularly appeared within the top 10 ranks in the university, with a few also achieving the very first rank.
                    HIT enjoys a distinct advantage of being located in the close vicinity of Aurangabad’s premier industrial estate, with renowned names like Bajaj Auto being our next-door neighbours. We have been maintaining close ties with all the local industries by calling them over to our campus for conducting workshops / seminars / symposia / conferences of interest to them. This activity not only enhances the practical professional knowledge of our students, it also helps them gain confidence about earning their place in the professional world once they graduate from our institute.
                    
                    Our institute has a disciplined team of well-qualified, experienced and dynamic staff members who maintain close relations with our students and also with their parents/guardians.
                    Over the years, this institute has produced thousands of engineers who have established themselves in various spheres: industry, business, government organizations, national laboratory, and even in careers abroad. We take pride in saying that their journey had begun right here, with the excellent professional knowledge and opportunities for personal growth which they received at this institute.
                    
                    We have been taking efforts and initiatives in enhancing job opportunities for our students. An Industry-Institute Interaction Cell is very actively maintained in our college.
